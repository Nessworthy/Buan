<p>
	Although not yet tested it should work fine with PHP 6.

	If you want to make use of "clean" URLs in your application then you will also need the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a> module and allow the use of <span class="path">.htaccess</span> files within your application's folders (see documentation for the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#allowoverride"><span class="code">AllowOverride</span></a> directive.)
