Requirements
============
PHP 5.3 with following extensions:
  pdo
  pdo_sqlite
	pdo_* (PDO extension for your chosen DB, eg. pdo_mysql)

Apache HTTPD (with mod_rewrite if you want to use "clean" URLs)


Apache configuration
====================
1. Add the following to your apache config file (eg. "httpd.conf"):

<Directory "/path/to/your/document/root">
	AllowOverride All
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>


Installation (quick start)
==========================
1. Copy the contents of the "application" folder to your intended application
folder.

2. If you have copied the files to a subfolder within your document root then
you will need to adjust and uncomment the relevant lines in ".htaccess"

2. Load up the application in a browser and you should see a welcome screen.


Installation (recommended)
==========================
1. Copy the contents of the "application" folder to your intended application
folder. This is probably your document root, but sub-folders within the document
root can be used too (with some associated adjustments - see below)

2. Move the "app" and "buan" folders to somewhere below your document root.

3. Open "index.php" and make adjustments necessary to tell the system where to
find the relocated "app" and "buan" folders.

4. Now you need to tell Apache where to redirect/alias calls to "/buan/buan-pub"
by adding the following to your VirtualHost block:

	Alias /buan/buan-pub /path/to/buan/buan-pub
	<Directory /path/to/buan/buan-pub>
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	</Directory>

4. Load up the application in a browser and you should see a welcome screen.


Troubleshooting
===============
If you've followed the above steps and cannot get that welcome message to
appear, then read through the following tips to try and resolve the issue.

1. I'm getting a "Access Denied"/"Authorization Required" message
Ensure that all the folders and files within your "buan-core" directory (and the
directory itself) are readable and executable by the user account under which
Apache is running, ie:

In linix/unix:
  $ cd /path/to/buan-core
  $ chmod -R a+rx *

In Windows XP:
  - Right click on "buan-core" and go to "Properties" then the "Security" tab.
    If you can't see the "Security" tab? see:
    http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/acl_sec_tab.mspx?mfr=true
  - Click "Add..." and type in the name of the user under which Apache is
    running, then click "Ok"
  - Click "Ok" until all dialog windows are closed then retry accessing the site

2. Absolutely nothing appears in the browser!
Make sure that the php directive "short_open_tag" is set to "Off".
Some templates use an xml declaration which comprises in part of "<?" (ie.
"<?xml version="1.0"?>"). If short_open_tag is "On", when the php parser reaches
this point in the template it throws an error. However, because output buffering
is enabled you may never see this error get thrown.
